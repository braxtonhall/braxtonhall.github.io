# On the Road

Taking a trip in the passenger seat

> some time in 2013 a stranger stopped me on the street  
> "that's a nice outfit, man - and those shoes!"
>
> six years later I danced with him in his home country  
> while Dutch boys played afrobeat
>
> I made this playlist with him
>
> looking forward to seeing you on the street again, Charlie
