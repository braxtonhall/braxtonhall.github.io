1. The playlist should be cohesive, i.e. it should attempt to maintain sonic or thematic similarity. Any major transition should be done gradually unless for some specific effect. Be a DJ
2. Celebrate your hidden treasures and noteable finds

## sy

1. option a: tell a complete story with the playlist. could be something as mundane as going to the gas station or something wild. have some plot twists! character development! it's up to you
2. option b: create a playlist that will make you disintegrate into the void Ã  la the disintegration loops. make the title the name of a nonexistent movie
