# Minecraft

I have played a _lot_ of Minecraft.

I mean definitely not as much as a YouTuber or Twitch streamer, but during quarantine
it was my main way of communicating with people.

My Minecraft server started in 2019. I liked the _idea_ of playing Minecraft, so I set it up.
I ran it off of an old laptop which we shoved in a cupboard, and the only person who played on the server
was my roommate, Victor.

Next to join was not me, but a friend of mine, and her boyfriend. Then her little sister, and her sister's friends.
There was a little community on the server and I hadn't been online yet.

Then it was COVID.

As a little hobby project outside of grad school while stuck inside, I decided I wanted to build an art gallery.[^1]
I recruited a bunch of my friends, had them buy Minecraft, and asked them to think about making an artwork in the game.

[^1]: I never built this art gallery...

However, we soon realised, that it takes more work that we thought to design a life-sized building.
Furthermore, it takes a _lot_ of time to get the blocks we needed to build a life-sized building.

So instead, we went mining, built towers to mark the way home, and made "homes" which were mostly holes in the dirt with boxes of precious metals we found underground.

Friends invited friends, and soon we were hosting karaoke parties in Minecraft on a virtual stage in a theatre I built with Cassandra.

There are a lot fewer people in my Minecraft world in 2024 than there were in 2021, but it's still around. If you want to play some Minecraft with me, my server information can be found [here](https://mc.braxtonhall.ca/).

## Ideas

I have a lot of ideas that I never got around to building. Here are some of them.

### 1. An original, life-sized art gallery

The art gallery would have different wings, and exhibitions.
The architecture of the building should also tell a story (a very old building that has been recently extended).
The exhibitions should be themed and the art built in game.
Lastly, there should be a sculpture/botanical garden outside.

### 2. A record store

There are 15 records in the game.
Every record should have custom album artwork that matches the vibe of the song, the name of the song, and the colour of the disc in the game.
All art should be original, and built in game pixel by pixel without cheating.

I got to 5 out of 15 records when it became too hard to pick designs. Each album took about three months of dedicated playing daily to build.

### 3. A visitors' centre

At spawn, there should be a big building to welcome visitors to the server.
It should have a map of the entire server, marked with notable locations, and compasses that point to some locations of note.
It should have a little exhibition featuring information on the people, places, and events from the history of the server.

### 4. A mixable music box

A music box that loops music, however the different instrument channels can be turned on or off _live_, allowing the player to DJ.
No matter when the player does, it should sound _good_.
One of the channels should also involve some "improvisation," with melodies and riffs that are played semi-randomly, in random order, but always in time with the music.

### 5. Cobwebs

Cover everyone's build with cobwebs!
