# racially charged shitpost 5

I was horrified when Chris told me  
"we all have that one race we wouldn't date"  
referring to his aversion to black women

I felt so defeated  
after an hour of trying to explain to him  
that this was indeed racism

yet three years later  
maybe I am coming around  
because I don't think I could date a white person

"there some things that shouldn't matter but do"
