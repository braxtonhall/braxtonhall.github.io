## Jerry

1. Pick two songs you like that you feel are as far apart musically/stylistically as possible. One of these songs will be the first song and the other will be the last song.
2. Fill in the rest of the playlist with songs changing in style gradually from the first song to the last, like you're painting a color wheel.
