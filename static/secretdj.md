# secret dj archive

a playlist sharing game

1. djs create two rules for the playlist that they wish to receive
2. then, they are randomly assigned another dj for whom they will make a playlist
3. the playlist is constrained by the other dj's rules

we played this game six times over five years. let this archive be the game's tombstone
